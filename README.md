Hello, I'm Minji(Chloe) Han, a developer dedicated to **enhancing experience**.
I understand the **importance of experience** through projects that improved customer and employee experiences.

Moving beyond planning and analyzing user(customer, employee and so on) experience improvements, I became a developer to **directly lead and make enhancements in detail.**

I aspire to be a developer deeply committed to understanding the user's perspective, never overlooking a single detail in my quest to enhance UX. By meticulously focusing on every aspect of user experience and continuously striving for improvement, I am dedicated to ensuring that every project not only meets but exceeds user expectations.
